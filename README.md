## Setting up

You'll need to install Git so that you can download this repository and make changes to this code base.
Git is a command line tool that you use to record the changes you make to the website.

You'll also need to install Python 3.6 and the Pip package manager. Python is a programming language that powers our website.
Pip is the Python package manager that lets you install 'packages' (bundled software) that we'll need to get the website up and running.
Django is an example of one of these packages that we use to power our website.

The packages required for this project are listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

### Windows

You can download Git [here](https://git-scm.com/download/). Once installed, you can use Git from the Git Bash program that is installed. We'll be typing in git commands into the Git bash program.

In Git bash, `cd` to a folder that you want to download the repo to. I would recommend cd'ing to your Documents folder (e.g. `cd ~/documents`). Then run `git clone https://github.com/ccditcluborg/ccditwebsite.git`.
That should download the code into a folder called `ccditclub`.

Next you'll need to install Python 3. Go [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to download it. Download the latest Python 3 (not Python 2!!) version.

### macOS

You can install Git by downloading the Xcode Command Line Tools. To do this, open up Terminal and type `git`.
You'll be prompted to download the Xcode Command Line Tools. Once that's finished,
On Linux, you can install Git
